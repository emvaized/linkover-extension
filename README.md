# <sub><img src="./src/assets/icon.png" height="40" width="40"></sub> Linkover – info tooltip on hover for links

Show info about any link on hover! 
This extension is able to load tab title, favicon, short description and thumbnails for many links you see over the internet and show it as a tooltip on hover. It uses [link-preview-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/link-preview-js) under the hood.

> [!WARNING]\
> Fetching info about link using this extension will act as if actually visited the page! It is recommended to not prefetch suspicious links. Although browser history will not get populated with these pages, no worries.
