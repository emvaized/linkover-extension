# <img src="./assets/icon.png" height="25" width="25"> Linkover – Tooltip for links on hover

Fetch info about any link on hover! 
This extension is able to fetch tab title, favicon, short description and thumbnails for many links you see over the internet. It uses [link-preview-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/link-preview-js) under the hood.

> [!WARNING]\
> Fetching info about link using this extension will act as if actually visited the page! It is recommended to not prefetch any suspicious links

> [!NOTE]\
> Some websites might be blocking access for "robots", recognize this extension as such and block access. Unfortunately there is not much we could do about it.
